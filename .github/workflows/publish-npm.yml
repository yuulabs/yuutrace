# Publish @yuutrace/ui to npm when a version tag is pushed,
# but ONLY if files under ui/ have changed since the last tag.

#
# Prerequisites:
#   1. On npmjs.com, go to package Settings → Trusted Publisher
#   2. Configure: org=yuulabs, repo=yuutrace,
#      workflow=publish-npm.yml, environment=(leave empty)
#
# Usage:
#   git tag v0.1.0
#   git push origin v0.1.0
